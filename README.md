The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed. The app also includes a "Clear All" button to delete all tasks at once.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Completed tasks will have a line-through to indicate completion.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete individual tasks.
Clear All Tasks: A button to clear all tasks from the list and local storage.
